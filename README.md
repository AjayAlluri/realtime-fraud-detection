# Real-Time Payment Fraud Detection System

A distributed, real-time fraud detection system built with Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Redis, and AWS services. This system processes payment transactions in real-time, applies multiple machine learning models for fraud detection, and provides instant decisions with sub-100ms latency.

## Architecture Overview

```
Payment Transactions → Kafka → Flink (ML Processing) → Redis → Decision Engine
                        ↓
                   AWS S3 (Data Lake) → SageMaker (ML Training) → Model Registry
                        ↓
                   Real-time Dashboard ← WebSocket ← API Gateway
                        ↓
              Kubernetes Orchestration ← Docker Containers ← CI/CD Pipeline
```

git checkout -b feature/feature-name

# Develop and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"

# Merge to phase branch
git checkout phase-X-name
git merge feature/feature-name
git push origin phase-X-name
```
