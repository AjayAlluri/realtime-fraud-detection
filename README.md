# Real-Time Payment Fraud Detection System

A distributed, real-time fraud detection system built with Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Redis, and machine learning models. This system processes payment transactions in real-time, applies multiple ML models for fraud detection, and provides instant decisions with sub-100ms latency.

## Architecture Overview

```
Payment Transactions → Kafka → Flink (ML Processing) → Redis → Decision Engine
                        ↓
                   Feature Store → ML Models → Real-time Predictions
                        ↓
                   Real-time Dashboard ← WebSocket ← REST API
                        ↓
              Kubernetes Orchestration ← Docker Containers ← Local Development
```

open http://localhost:3000
```

#### Kubernetes (Production)
```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
helm install fraud-detection ./k8s/helm/fraud-detection

# Port forward to access dashboard
kubectl port-forward svc/dashboard 3000:3000

# Access dashboard
open http://localhost:3000
```

git checkout -b feature/feature-name

# Develop and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"

# Merge to phase branch
git checkout phase-X-name
git merge feature/feature-name
git push origin phase-X-name
```
